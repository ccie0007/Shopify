 What Your App Can Do (That Shopify Native Import Can’t):
Automate Imports

Schedule imports (e.g., nightly, hourly).
Trigger imports from FTP, email, or API—no manual upload needed.
Custom CSV Formats

Accept any column names or structure (not just Shopify’s strict format).
Map columns flexibly (e.g., handle supplier files with different headers).
Advanced Logic

Update only certain fields (e.g., just price or just inventory).
Apply business rules (e.g., don’t allow price drops below cost).
Merge, aggregate, or transform data before import.
Integrations

Connect with other systems (ERP, WMS, suppliers).
Send notifications, logs, or reports after import.
Bulk Actions & Error Handling

Show detailed error messages for each row.
Retry failed imports automatically.
Rollback on failure.
User Permissions & Audit

Track who imported what, and when.
Restrict import actions by user role.
API Access

Allow other apps or partners to trigger imports via API.
