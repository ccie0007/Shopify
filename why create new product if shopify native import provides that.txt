Great question!
If users can already create new products using Shopify’s native CSV import, why build this feature in your app?

Why build product creation in your app?
Shopify Native Import:

Manual: User must log in, upload the file, and wait for processing.
Strict format: Must match Shopify’s CSV exactly.
No automation: Can’t schedule or trigger automatically.
No custom logic: Can’t validate, transform, or enrich data.
No integrations: Can’t pull from FTP, email, or other systems.
No feedback: Limited error reporting, no custom notifications.
Your App:

Automation: Schedule imports, trigger from FTP/email/API, or run on a timer.
Custom CSV formats: Accept supplier/customer files, map columns as needed.
Custom logic: Validate data, enrich with extra info, auto-tag, set metafields, etc.
Integrations: Connect with ERPs, WMS, suppliers, or other business systems.
User experience: Show progress, detailed errors, logs, and notifications.
Permissions & audit: Track who imported what, when, and how.
Bulk actions: Combine product creation with inventory, price, or image updates in one workflow.
