Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs a cheat sheet of industry-standard CSV automation features you can safely use without worrying you‚Äôre ‚Äúcopying‚Äù EasyCSV.
These are common in ETL tools, Shopify import/export apps, and automation platforms ‚Äî so they‚Äôre fair game.

1. Data Input Sources (Common)

Upload via browser (manual CSV/Excel files)

Google Sheets import

Email attachment ingestion

FTP/SFTP server downloads

Pull from a public/private API endpoint

Dropbox / Google Drive / OneDrive imports

2. Data Output Destinations (Common)

Shopify product, order, customer updates

Google Sheets export

FTP/SFTP upload

Email with CSV attachment

Direct API push to a target system

3. Automation & Scheduling (Common)

Run every X hours/days

Trigger on file arrival in a folder or email inbox

Cron job‚Äìstyle custom schedules

Conditional execution (run only if file changes)

4. Data Mapping & Transformation (Common)

Map CSV columns to destination fields

Merge multiple CSVs

Split a CSV by row conditions

Format dates, numbers, currency

Add static columns (e.g., "Vendor: MyCompany")

Remove columns or rows

Replace text values (find/replace)

5. Filtering & Validation (Common)

Skip rows that don‚Äôt meet a condition (e.g., stock > 0)

Validate data format before upload (e.g., valid SKU, correct price format)

Reject job if required fields are missing

6. User Experience Enhancements (Common)

Preview results before running

Job logs & history

Error notifications by email

Role-based access for team members

Template-based setups for specific platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)

üí° Where you can innovate to stand out:

AI-powered column mapping (auto-match columns by name and data type)

Mobile-friendly dashboard (most automation tools ignore mobile)

Visual transformation editor (drag-and-drop steps instead of forms)

One-click multi-store updates (update multiple Shopify stores from one CSV)

Real-time sync with Google Sheets (instant push on edit)

If you want, I can take these and build you a ‚Äúcore + advanced + differentiator‚Äù feature roadmap so you know exactly what to launch first, and what to add later to surpass EasyCSV.
